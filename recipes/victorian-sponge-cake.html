    </ul>


    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). 
            Grease two 8-inch round cake pans with baking spray; line bottoms with parchment paper. 
            Lightly spray parchment paper with baking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sift flour, cornstarch, and baking powder into a medium bowl; whisk in salt and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. 
            (The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat in eggs, one at a time, on medium speed, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next, 1 to 2 minutes total. 
            Beat in 2 teaspoons vanilla. With mixer on medium-low speed, add flour mixture in 3 batches, 
            alternating with milk, beating until just combined after each addition.
        </li>
        <li>
            Evenly divide batter between prepared pans and spread into an even layer using a small offset spatula. 
            Firmly tap pans on a kitchen towel-lined counter several times to help get rid of any large bubbles in the batter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 18 to 22 minutes. 
            Cool cakes in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto a wire rack. 
            Let stand, parchment side down, on wire racks until cooled completely, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove and discard parchment paper. Place 1 cake layer on a serving plate. 
            Stir preserves in a small bowl until mostly smooth; spread in an even layer over cake.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make vanilla whipped cream: Whisk heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, 
            and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract by hand in a large bowl until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dollop over jam, then spread into an even layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top with remaining cake layer. Dust with powdered sugar and garnish with strawberries (if using).
        </li>
    </ol>
