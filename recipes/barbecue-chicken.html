    <p>When it comes to grilled barbecue chicken, everyone wants a nice thick barbecue glaze attached to the skin, and the only way to do it is to brush it on as it cooks. 
        But because barbecue sauce has such a high sugar content, 
        it only takes a minute for it to go from brick red to solid black
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken, cut into halves</li>
        <li>¼ cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons barbecue sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <1i>teaspoon onion powder</1i> 
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup barbecue sauce, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut 1/2-inch deep slashes in the skin-side of each chicken half: two cuts in each breast, 
            two in each thigh, and one in each leg. Remove wing tips.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk vinegar, 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce, and garlic together in a large bowl. Place chicken in the bowl and turn to coat. 
            Arrange chicken halves in the bottom of the bowl with the cut sides down; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove chicken from the bowl and pat dry with paper towels; discard any remaining marinade. Place chicken halves, 
            skin-side up, on a plate and season with salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, and cayenne pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill until grill marks appear, 3 to 4 minutes. 
            Turn chicken over, close the grill lid, and cook, basting with remaining barbecue sauce every 6 minutes, 
            until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
